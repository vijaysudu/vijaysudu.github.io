# Data Science Final Project
My name is Vijay Sudharshan and I like Pokemon. I got into Pokemon as a child and loved the movies and games and TV series that were all a part of the franchise. However, I only recently got into the video game series as they were a little convoluted for me as a child. The Pokemon video game franchise is one of the most popular to date and has it's own professional tournaments that you can compete in. Nintendo reinvigorated the game by releasing Pokemon Go in collaboration with Niantic which has its own version of Pokemon battles. In this tutorial, I shall come up with an algorithm to find the best 10 pokemon to beat a given pokemon using their stats and moves. I shall analyze the data primarily using dataframes. The Pokemon I want to beat are the top tier Pokemon according to http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-12-15-pokemon-go-best-pokemon-highest-hp-attack-defence-stats. The dataset I shall use is from Kaggle which was a resource recommended by our professors: https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon
